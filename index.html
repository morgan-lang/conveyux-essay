        <h2>Principles of Good UX</h2>
        <p>The best design is that whose function is perfectly apparent from its appearance.</p>
        <p>Background and context of contemporary technical writing: Tim Berners-Lee invented the WWW to provide documentation at CERN.

</p>
        
       <h2>UX is a Growth Industry</h2> 
          <p>This need will expand as technology expands, although the exact form of delivery will change. Example: recent studies indicate that car owners are less inclined than ever to read bound paper manuals, yet driver distractions are proliferating in the car cabin and this presents a real danger. Good UX could solve this by providing in-dash tutorials. You can’t use the handsfree features until you’ve passed training. “Vehicles have become a “temporary” mobile workplace and home-place for both drivers and passengers” http://www.auto-ui.org/12/adjunct-proceedings/t5-ux-design-vehicles-tscheligi.pdf</p>
        
        <h2>UX will move beyond the merely visual</h2>
        <p>There must be cross-pollination between graphic and info designers. There is a guiding principle in web design: design for mobile first. So, too, should TW’s. As part of that emphasis on designing for mobile, TW’s must learn to use the language of iconography.But UX must look beyond the merely visual.</p>
        
        <h2>User Guidance will be everywhere</h2>
        <p>Studies and reports show that users don’t read manuals (cite). The challenge, therefore, is to work instructional cues into everything: advertising, iconography, splash pages. Don’t bury user guides – reduce them to a few words and symbols and put them right on the main product page. https://www.hugeinc.com/ideas/perspective/riding-in-cars-with-uis

</p>
        
        <h2>Printed media are still essential</h2>
        <p>This is in direct contradiction to the former assertions, but it remains true for some types of interfaces. What are the advantages of print? Print allows instant scannability, instant gestalt perception. No clicking, no scrolling. Print also has a resolution advantage. A graphic can fill an entire page and it doesn’t disrupt flow, as opposed to having a popup or clickthrough image (bad design practice). See Edward Tufte. Blueprints and schematics will continue to be primarily understood in print form. Compact guidebooks and maps will continue to be valuable in scenarios where batteries and electronic devices aren’t practical: extreme environments, long treks, exposure to water. On the ISS, there must be a printed manual for recharging the power cells or batteries if the power goes out and there is catastrophic failure.

        <h2>Present, near future, far future</h2>
        <p>Near future: enhanced reality through earpieces and glasses. Privacy is key. No glassholes.
Far future: that privacy is further enhanced by direct embedding via bioware.
More than one simultaneous channel: connect your tablet to your car and learn the car’s UI that way. Directions appear on the tablet, then you respond using the car’s interface.
